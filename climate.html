                    The Walnut Islands have a wonderful warm temperate climate year-round. Beautiful beaches can be found throughout all of the islands. The climate also allows residents to enjoy the hunting grounds of Slabahnu or the outdoor shopping center of the CBD.

                <h3>Migration</h3>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    A large amount of wealthy businessmen moved to the Walnut Islands shortly after it was founded in 2008. While the rate of population growth has decreased since the initial rush in 2008, there is still some population growth from net in-migration. The
                    borders are secured by our personal security team, which also maintains order around the islands. In order to immigrate, it is mandatory to pay the entrance fee of $425,000.00 USD per person. Paying the fee also makes one a citizen
                    and grants them the rank of resident. All migration is voluntary, usually carried out by businessmen who seek the financial advantages of living in the Walnut Islands.</p>

                        <h3>Population Pyramid</h3>
                        <p class="flow-text">The Republic of the Walnut Islands has a large middle-aged population, as many high-ranking businessmen are around this age. While most wealthy businessmen are men, a very large portion of them are married, and their wives live
                            on the island with them, so as a result, the genders are roughly equal.
